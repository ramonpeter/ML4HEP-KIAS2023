# dlpp-tutorials
Tutorials originally created for the Deep Learning in Particle Physics course, spring semester 2022, at the University of Heidelberg.
These tutorials were produced and delivered by Barry Dillon with the help of PhD students at the university:  Luigi Favaro, Theo Heimel, and Michel Luchmann.
They were modified in 2023 by Claudius Krause.

The physics datasets used for these tutorials were slightly too big to put here, but they can be downloaded at:

Much of the data is reused in different tutorials.
